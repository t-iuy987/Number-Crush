# Number-Crush
Number Crush is a "match-three" game, where the core game play is based on
swapping two adjacent random values among several on the game board to make a
row or column of at least 3 matching-random values. On this match, the matched
random values are removed from the board, and random values above them fall
into the empty spaces, with new random values appearing from the top of the board.
This may create a new matched set of random values, which is automatically cleared
in the same manner. The game is split among many levels, which must be
completed in sequence.
